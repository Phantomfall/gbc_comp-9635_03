			<h1>Saviour of the World Chinese Catholic Church</h1>
			<p>This is Saviour of the World Chinese Catholic Church. It is in the west region of the Archdiocese of Toronto. It is located at 30 Bristol Road West, Mississauga, Ontario, L5R 3k3.</p>
			<p>I belong to Saviour of the World Chinese Catholic Church. I have been with this church since its establishment in 1995. When the church wanted to start its website, I volunteered to help with maintaining it.</p>
			<p>Its website has been around for a while and now it looks very outdated. Plus I did not know much about coding before and probably had messed up the codes quite badly.</p>
			<p>I think it is time to update the website. So I decided to learn web design a couple of years ago. I have already completed the web design certificate. Other than this course, I just need one more course to complete my web development certificate.</p>
			<p>Completing the certificates is one thing, being able to actually design and develop a website takes a lot of knowledge and experience. Since I am not working in the field, I finds it hard to remember all the codes!</p>

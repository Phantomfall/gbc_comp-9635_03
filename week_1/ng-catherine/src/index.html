		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>My name is Catherine Ng. I work at Dufferin-Peel Catholic School Board providing administrative support to the academic staff.</p>
		<p><img src="images/Web-Developer-Skills-1.jpg" id="skills">I have a lot of hobbies and building website is one of them. It all started when I wanted to have my own website but did not want to spend a lot of money hiring someone to build it for me. So I started taking web design courses at George Brown. After the Web Design Certificate, I felt that I would like to go further. Now I am just two courses away from getting the Web Development Certificate!</p>
